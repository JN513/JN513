## About Me

Hello, my name is Julio Nunes Avelar, a Brazilian maker since I can remember. I have a degree in Information Technology and I am currently a Computer Engineering student at the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP).

I am a huge hardware enthusiast and love developing new things. I am part of UNICAMP's study and development group for embedded systems ([Embarcações](https://embarcacoes.ic.unicamp.br)). In my spare time, I maintain a technology blog called [Bzóide](https://bzoide.dev), contribute to open-source projects, and work on some random projects, many of which are openly available on this GitHub.
